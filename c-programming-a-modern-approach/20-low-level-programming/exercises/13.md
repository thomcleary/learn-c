# Exercise 13

If `n` is an `unsigned int` variable, what effect does the following statement have on the bits in `n`?

```c
n &= n - 1;
```

_Hint_: Consider the effect on `n` if this statement is executed more than once.

## Answer

- `n` = 14 = `0000_1110`

- `n = 14 & 13` = `0000_1110 & 0000_1101` = `0000_1100`
- `n = 12 & 11` = `0000_1100 & 0000_1011` = `0000_1000`
- `n = 8 & 7` = `1000 & 0111` = `0`

The statement removes the rightmost `1` bit from `n`.

Each time the statement is executed, `n`'s rightmost `1` bit is set to `0`
