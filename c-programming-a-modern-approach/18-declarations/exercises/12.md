# Exercise 12

(a) Write a complete description of the type of the function `f`, assuming that it's declared as follows

```c
int (*f(float (*)(long), char *))(double);
```

(b) Give an example showing how `f` would be called.

## Answers

(a)

- `f` is a function that takes 2 arguments, a pointer to a function that accepts a long argument and returns a float, and a char pointer. It returns a pointer to a function that accepts a double argument and returns a int.

(b)

```c
float g(long);
char *str;

int n = f(g, str)(3.14);
```
