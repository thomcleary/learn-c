# Exercise 04

Let `f` be the following function.

```c
int f(int i)
{
    static int j = 0;
    return i * j++;
}
```

What will be the value of `f(10)` if `f` has never been called before? What will be the value of `f(10)` if `f` has been called five times previously?

## Answer

- `f(10)` on first call is `0`
- `f(10)` on sixth call is `50`
