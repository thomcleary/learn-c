# Exercise 13

Which of the following declarations are legal? (Assume that `PI` is a macro that represents 3.14159)

(a) `char c = 65;`

(b) `static int i = 5, j = i * i;`

(c) `double d = 2 * PI`

(d) `double angles[] = {0, PI / 2, PI, 3 * PI / 2};`

## Answer

a, c, d are legal

b is not legal as the initializer of a static variable must be a constant expression, which `i * i` is not.
