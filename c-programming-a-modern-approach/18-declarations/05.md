# Exercise 05

State whether each of the following statements is true or false. Justify each answer

(a) Every variable with static storage duration has file scope

(b) Every variable declared inside a function has no linkage

(c) Every variable with internal linkage has static storage duration

(d) Every parameter has block scope

## Answer

(a) False, block scoped variables can be static

(b) False, a variable inside a function can be declared as `extern` and initialized in another file

(c) True, to have internal linkage a variable must be declared at file scope and as static, and hence has static storage duration

(d) True, as parameters are pass by value
