# Exercise 9

True or false:

- If `x` is a structure and `a` is a member of that structure, then `(&x)->a` is the same as `x.a`. Justify your answer.

## Answer

True

`x` can reference `a` directly via the dot operator as it is a struct, not a pointer to a struct.

`(&x)` is an expression resulting in the address of `x`, a pointer to `x`, which can reference `a` via the arrow operator. It will expand to `*(&x).a` which is equivalent to `x.a`.
