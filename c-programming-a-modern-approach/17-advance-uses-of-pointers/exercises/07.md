# Exercise 7

The following loop is supposed to delete all nodes from a linked list and release the memory that they occupy. Unfortunately, the loop is incorrect. Explain what's wrong with it and show how to fix the bug.

```c
for (p = first; p != NULL; p = p->next)
{
    free(p);
}
```

## Answer

The pointer to the current node is free'd before the for loops increment statement is executed.
`p = p->next` attempts to access memory that is no longer allocated.

To fix, a temporary reference to the current node can be created before freeing the node

```c
for (p = first; p != NULL;) {
    struct node *to_delete = p;
    p = p->next;
    free(to_delete);
}
```
