# Exercise 13

The following function is supposed to insert a new node into its proper place in an ordered list, returning a pointer to the first node in the modified list. Unfortunately, the function doesn't work correctly in all cases. Explain what's wrong with it and show how to fix it. Assume that the node structure is the one defined in Section 17.5.

```c
struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
{
    struct node *cur = list, *prev = NULL;
    while (cur->value <= new_node->value) {
        prev = cur;
        cur = cur->next;
    }
    prev->next = new_node;
    new_node->next = cur;
    return list;
}
```

## Answer

It does not handle edge cases

- When `list` is empty
- When new_node must be added to end of list, `cur` is `NULL` after loop end
- When new_node must be added to the front of the list, `prev` is `NULL` after loop end

```c
struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
{
    if (list == NULL) {
        return new_node;
    }

    struct node *cur = list, *prev = NULL;
    while (cur != NULL && cur->value <= new_node->value) {
        prev = cur;
        cur = cur->next;
    }

    new_node->next = cur;

    if (prev == NULL) {
        return new_node;
    }

    prev->next = new_node;
    return list;
}
```
