# Exercise 10

The following function supposedly creates an identical copy of a string. What's wrong with the function?

```c
char *duplicate(const char *p)
{
    char *q;

    strcpy(q, p);

    return q;
}
```

## Answer

q has only been declared and not initialized. `strcpy` will attempt to copy `p` into some random place in memory.
