# Exercie 8

What will be the value of the string `str` after the following statements have been executed?

```c
strcpy(str, "tire-bouchon");
strcpy(&str[4], "d-or-wi");
strcat(str, "red?");
```

## Answer

- NULL
- "tire-bouchone`
- "tired-or-wi\0ne`

The bytes following the null byte are no longer part of the string so...

- "tired-or-wi\0`
- "tired-or-wired?\0`
