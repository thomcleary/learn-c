# Exercise 2

Suppose that `p` has been declared as follows

```c
char *p = "abc";
```

Which of the following function calls are legal? Show the output produced by each legal call, and explain why the others are illegal.

- (a) `putchar(p);`
- (b) `putchar(*p);`
- (b) `puts(p);`
- (d) `puts(*p);`

## Answer

- (a) is not legal
  - `putchar` accepts an integer argument, not a pointer to a char/int
- (b) is legal
  - `a`
- (c) is legal
  - `abc\n`
- (d) is not legal
  - `puts` accepts a pointer to a string, not a char
