# Exercise 5

Suppose that f and p are declared as follow:

```c
struct {
    union {
        char a, b;
        int c;
    } d;
    int e[5];
} f, *p = &f;
```

Which of the follow statements are legal?

- (a) `p->b = ' ';`
- (b) `p->e[3] = 10`
- (c) `(*p).d.a = '*'`
- (d) `p->d->c = 20`

## Answer

b and c

(a) Is not legal, as you need to first reference `d` to access `b`, `p->d.b`

(d) Is not legal, as d is not a pointer, c should be accessed with the dot operator `p->d.c`
