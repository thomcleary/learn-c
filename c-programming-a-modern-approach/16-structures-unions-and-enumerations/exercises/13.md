# Exercise 13

Suppose that s is the following structure (point structure is declared in 10.c)

```c
struct shape
{
    int shape_kind; /* RECTANGLE or CIRCLE */
    struct point center;
    union
    {
        struct
        {
            int height, width;
        } rectangle;
        struct
        {
            int radius;
        } circle
    } u;
} s;
```

If the value of shape_kind is RECTANGLE, the height and width members store the dimensions of a rectangle.
If the value of shape_kind is CIRCLE, the radius member stores the radius of a circle.
Indicate which of the following statements are legal and show how to repair the ones that aren't.

- (a) `s.shape_kind = RECTANGLE`
- (b) `s.center.x = 10;`
- (c) `s.height = 25;`
- (d) `s.u.rectangle.width = 8;`
- (e) `s.u.circle = 5;`
- (f) `s.u.radius = 5;`

## Answers

- (a) Legal
- (b) Legal
- (c) `s.u.rectangle.height = 25;`
- (d) Legal
- (e) `s.u.circle.radius = 5;`
- (f) `s.u.circle.radius = 5;`
