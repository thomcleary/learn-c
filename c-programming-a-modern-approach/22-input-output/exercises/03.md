# Exercise 3

Find the error in the following program fragment and show how to fix it

```c
FILE *fp;

if ((fp = fopen(filename, "r"))) {
    // read characters until end of file
}
fclose(fp);
```

## Answer

The man page says:

`The fclose() function does not handle NULL arguments; they will result in a segmentation violation.`

If `fopen` is not able to open the file with `filename`, it will return `NULL` and `fp` will be `NULL`.

Which is then passed to `fclose`.

To fix this, only call `fclose` when `fopen` succeeds

```c
FILE *fp;

if ((fp = fopen(filename, "r")) == NULL)
{
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

// read characters until end of file
fclose(fp);
```
