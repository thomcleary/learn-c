# Exercise 8

In previous chapters, we've used the scanf format string `" %c"` when we wanted to skip white-space characters and read a nonblank character. Some programmers use `" 8 1 s "` instead. Are the two techniques equivalent? If not, what are the differences?

## Answer

No they are not equivalent.

The `%1s` conversion specifier will skip preceding whitespace, and have a maximum field width of `1`, hence only reading 1 character

However, using `s` whill null terminate the `char *` being assigned to, where as `c` will not.
