# Exercise 11

The following loop appears in the fcopy. c program:

```c
while ((ch = getc (source_fp)) =| EOF)
    putc (ch, dest_ fp);
```

Suppose that we neglected to put parentheses around `ch = getc(source_fp);`:

```c
while (ch = getc(source_fp) != EOF)
    putc(ch, dest_fp);
```

Would the program compile without an error? If so, what would the program do when it's run?

## Answer

Yes the program would compile without error (if warnings are not treated as errors as some flags enable).

When the program is run `ch` would be set to the result of the expression `getc(source_fp) != EOF` each time the `while` loop expression is executed.

If `getc(source_fp)` does not return `EOF` the value of `ch` will be 1, and the loop body will executing, writing `1` into `dest_fp`.

This will continue until `getc` returns `EOF`.
