# Exercise 9

Which one of the following calls is not a valid way of reading one character from the standard input stream?

- (a) getch()
- (b) getchar()
- (c) getc(stdin)
- (d) fgetc(stdin)

## Answer

`getch` is not a standard library function

On my Intel Macbook `man getch` says it is part of the `<curses.h>` header
