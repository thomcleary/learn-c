# Exercise 7

Let `GENERIC_MAX` be the following macro:

```c
#define GENERIC_MAX(type)       \
type type##_max(type x, type y) \
{                               \
    return x > y ? x : y;       \
}
```

- (a) Show the preprocessor's expansion of `GENERIC_MAX(long)`
- (b) Explain why `GENERIC_MAX` doesn't work for basic types such as `unsigned long`
- (c) Describe a technique that would allow us to use `GENERIC_MAX` with basic types such as `unsigned long`. _Hint_: Don't change the definition of `GENERIC_MAX`

## Answers

### (a)

```c
long long_max(long x, long y)
{
    return x > y ? x : y;
}
```

## (b)

The signature of the generated function will be

```c
unsigned long unsigned long_max(unsigned long x, unsigned long y)
```

The function name should not contain whitespace

## (c)

A type definition can be used to rename the type

`typedef unsigned long ULONG`

Which can be passed to the macro

`GENERIC_MAX(ULONG)`
