# Exercise 4

For each of the following macros, give an example that illustrates a problem with the macro and show how to fix it.

(a) `#define AVG(x,y)   (x+y)/2`
(b) `#define AREA(x,y)  (x)*(y)`

## Answer

- (a) Lack of parenthesis around the replacement list can lead to unintended effects

  - `1/AVG(x, y)` -> `1/(x+y)/2`
  - Should be `#define AVG(x,y) (((x)+(y))/2)` -> `1/AVG(x, y)` -> `1/((x+y)/2)`

- (b) Lack of parenthesis around the replacement list
  - `1/AREA(x, y)` -> `1/(x)*(y)`
  - Should be `#define AREA(x,y) ((x)*(y))` -> `1/AREA(x, y)` -> `1/((x)*(y))`
