# Exercise 1

Locate where the header files are kept on your system. Find the nonstandard headers and determine the purpose of each.

## Answer

To find where `clang` searches for header files

```shell
$ echo | clang -v -E -

...
/usr/local/include
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/clang/15.0.0/include
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks (framework directory)
...
```

Standard headers can be found in multiple of those locations.

There's too many nonstandard headers to list...

One for example is `CommonDigest.h` located at `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/CommonCrypto`

- This header file provides function prototypes of various hash functions like `MD5`
