# Exercise 02

Having located the header files on your system (see Exercise 1), find a standard header in which a macro hides a function.

## Answer

```shell
$ cd /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include
$ cat stdio.h | grep getchar
int getchar(void);
int getchar_unlocked(void);
#define getchar_unlocked()  getc_unlocked(stdin)
```
